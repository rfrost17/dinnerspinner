# dinnerspinner
Android app for the simple question "What's for dinner?"

General idea: App is opened and current location is used. A radius is selected from current location with a number of options for the category of food. A wheel is then generated and spun to randomly select a food place to eat. Re-spins are available when rating is low enough. Once the place is selected by the wheel, directions will be given to the place.
